        <p style="font-size: 12px;">Accordingly a patient may be advised that if they do not agree to their information being<br>
            stored or shared in a particular way, the clinician or health service may not be in a position<br>
            to offer them a service. The Foundation for Information Policy Research (Anderson, 2004)<br>
            has criticised the draft UK NHS patient information sharing charter (NHS 2002) for<br>
            including a statement of this nature that makes specific reference to the potential refusal<br>
            of treatment, if a patient’s decision to restrict information sharing, is considered to make<br>
            them untreatable or their treatment dangerous</p><br>

            <p style="font-size: 12px;">Healthcare, and indeed human physiology and disease progression are increasingly<br>
                recognised for their complexity and non-linear dynamics, where there are limitations for<br>
                reductionistic views and solutions that do not or can not recognise or adapt to that<br>
                complexity (Plsek & Greenhalgh, 2001; Goldberger, 1996). This section will not attempt<br>
                an exploration of the theory or to utilise the formal language of non-linear dynamics, but<br>
                again, through the use of metaphor and perspectives, aims to convey some of that<br>
                complexity, particularly as it relates to privacy and security and the implementation of<br>
                electronic health knowledge management systems</p><br>
                <p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: normal;"  ><b><u>Knowledge Neurones and the Therapeutic Knowledge<br>
                    Alliance</b></u><br></p><br>
                    <p style="font-size: 12px;">From a distance and at a fixed point in time clinical information may appear to be<br>
                        exchanged in a simple linear chain like fashion. For example, organisation or person A<br>
                        communicates with organisation or person B who communicates with organisation or<br>
                        person C, and all may be expected to exchange the same information in a standardised<br>
                        format.<br>
                        Therefore conceptually, one might hope to control the flow of information by mapping<br>
                        these connections and asking a patient who trusted connections they consent or agree<br>
                        to have in their own particular chain and under what conditions information should flow<br>
                        along it. However in reality there are often a series of intermingling web-like connections,<br>
                        both within and between multiple organisations and their constituent individuals that are<br>
                        continually being realigned, reshaped and restructured over time. Additionally, as<br>
                        opposed to information being passed in a single standardised format, there are often<br>
                        different variants or segments of the information passed between each connection</p><br>
                        <p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: normal;"  ><b><u>Knowledge Neurones</b></u><br></p>
                        <p style="font-size: 12px;">In addition to electronic health information systems storing text-based records clinicians<br>
                            utilise a multitude of other channels to transfer and manage health information. These<br>
                            include paper records, phones, personal digital assistants, pagers, voicemail, fax, e-mail,<br>
                            and not least conversation or personal and group interaction. Therefore, rather than<br>

                            <p style="font-size: 12px;">being considered a simple link in a linear knowledge chain, a clinician can be considered<br>
                                as being at the centre of a multi-pronged spherical neurone like structure, with each prong<br>
                                representing a different channel through which they may connect with others, to push,<br>
                                pull, and produce knowledge.<br>
                                Electronic health knowledge management systems may assist the clinician in the<br>
                                continuous process of integrating these multiple channels and adding or discerning<br>
                                intelligence. The clinician may strengthen or utilise more channels perceived to add value<br>
                                and ignore or weaken channels perceived to add less value. “Value” may be a function<br>
                                of perceived ability to integrate and add intelligence, and can vary by individual, context,<br>
                                and time.<br>
                                Historically the “therapeutic alliance” concept has had an evolving meaning, but carries<br>
                                the sense of clinician and patient working together (Goldstein, 1999). Similarly, the earlier<br>
                                definition of a health knowledge management system attempted to convey the sense of<br>
                                GPs, allied health services, and patients and their supports all working together. We<br>
                                could consider each of these groups as forming their own knowledge neurones and<br>
                                conceptualise a “therapeutic knowledge alliance” comprising of a web of these inter-<br>
                                weaving knowledge neurones, all supporting each other and working together to make<br>
                                a healthy difference.<br>
                                Healthcare may involve a spectrum of clinical presentations or scenarios that have to be<br>
                                managed, which can be described as simple certainty to complex ambiguity (Figure 4).<br>
                                The range from simple to complex relates to the number of caregivers and interventions<br>
                                that may have to be coordinated in a patient’s care in relation to their condition or multiple<br>
                                conditions. Certainty to ambiguity relates to the degree of perceived accuracy or<br>
                                certainty with regard to the diagnosis or diagnoses and the potential effectiveness of<br>
                                interventions or treatments.<br>
                                Traditionally, as clinicians have moved from simple certainty to complex ambiguity, they<br>
                                have utilised an increasing array of resources within their therapeutic knowledge</p><br>

<p style="font-size: 12px;">alliance. This typically includes their multidisciplinary team colleagues directly involved<br>
    in the patient’s care in the form of ward rounds or case conferences, but can also involve<br>
    de-identified case presentations, to non-involved peers or senior colleagues for support<br>
    and advice on how to best manage this complexity and ambiguity.<br>
    The quest for increasingly highly structured data runs the risk of adopting a cloak of<br>
    scientific certainty that loses the art of dealing with this often-prevalent complex<br>
    ambiguity in clinical practice. A specialist may have more factual knowledge or skill in<br>
    a particular clinical area than a generalist or someone in training, but it is often their ability<br>
    to recognise, adapt and cope with what they do not know, or what is not initially clear<br>
    that provides their particular value. A patient’s presentation may not fit neatly into a<br>
    specific textbook or diagnostic category, but a specialist may say to a referrer: “I have<br>
    a sense this patient may be suffering from condition A or maybe B; however, I do not<br>
    know the exact answer either, but let’s monitor and manage the situation this way.”<br>
    Similarly, the value in sharing a case with colleagues is often not so much that they<br>
    provide an immediate diagnosis or recommend you dramatically change the management,<br>
    but more that they provide support and contain anxiety that you have not missed<br>
    anything obvious, and that you are taking a course that would best manage a range of<br>
    possibilities that may become evident over time (Smith, 1996).<br>
    Intuition and learning from experience to cope with complex ambiguity is an aspect of the<br>
    art of medicine that could arguably be just sophisticated learned pattern recognition and<br>
    risk management that is and will be increasingly codifiable in electronic form. Indeed, a<br>
    central aim of an electronic health knowledge management system should be to enhance<br>
    and develop the capability of the health system and the individuals within it, to adapt<br>
    and cope with varying degrees of complexity and ambiguity. However, at present there<br>
    is a need to recognise the relative limitations of structured electronic data and guidelines,<br>
    for dealing with complex ambiguous clinical scenarios, and to recognise the current<br>
    reality of how clinicians cope with that complex ambiguity (Figure 5)</p><br>

    <img src="cc.PNG">
    <p style="font-size: 12px;">The above section and Figure 5 refer to the increasing relative utility of the wider<br>
        therapeutic knowledge alliance versus structured data and guidelines when dealing with<br>
        increasing levels of complex ambiguity. However, this of course does not infer no utility.<br>
        An electronic health knowledge management system, particularly one focused on care<br>
        coordination management, could be of increasing utility, effectiveness, and efficiency<br>
        in helping manage complex ambiguous health scenarios (Figure 6).</p><br>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: normal;"><u><b>Channel Management and the Therapeutic Knowledge Alliance</b></p></u><br>
        <p style="font-size: 12px;">Many Information System developments may just add additional channels to manage,<br>
            diluting limited resource and consuming more time and may not be of immediate perceived<br>
            benefit. The clinician may have to utilise multiple poorly integrated channels, with the<br>
            concern that increasing levels of non-productive channel management activity may lead<br>
            to decreased performance across the range of clinical, administrative, research, and<br>
            educational activities. Privacy and security interventions should aim to optimise perfor-<br>
            mance and minimise the level of associated channel management activities that may lead<br>
            to decreased performance (Figure 7).<br>
            Senior clinicians’ failure to use electronic information systems to the same degree as their<br>
            junior colleagues is often attributed to their reluctance or fear of change or technology,<br>
            when the reality may be they have established channel management methods that are<br>
            more productive and efficient in terms of their limited time. The clinician, rather than<br>
            seeking or entering data on a computer, may perceive the most efficient use of their time<br>
            may be to seek information from a trusted colleague who can integrate, and quickly add<br>
            intelligence or make sense of the data, or may communicate with a trusted individual<br>
            verbally to carry out some recommended course of action. A telephone or face-to-face<br>
            interaction may be perceived as a more effective way to clarify ambiguity and convey<br>
            knowledge not easily structured or codified, and come to a shared understanding on the<br>
            course forward</p><br>
<hr><hr>
<p style="font-size: 12px;"><i>Figure 7. Performance versus channel management activity</i></p><br>
<img src="dd.PNG">
<p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: normal;"><u>Elevator, Corridor and Coffee Table Conversations</p></u><br>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">There have been longstanding concerns with regard to clinicians discussing patient<br>
    information in public places, where they can be overheard (Vigod, Bell & Bohnen, 2003).<br>
    A lack of respect or appreciation of patient confidentiality may be one facet of this<br>
    behaviour. However within the concept of the therapeutic knowledge alliance we also<br>
    need to consider some of the other drivers. These include the increasing mobility and<br>
    fragmentation of the workforce and use of mobile communications and the decrease in<br>
    segregated or dedicated space for clinicians. The clinician may be answering an urgent<br>
    cell phone or pager call, or these locations may be one of the few contexts in which they<br>
    perceive they can access a colleague or group of colleagues in a timely fashion to discuss<br>
    or seek advice or support on a patient’s care.<br>
    In terms of advising a patient on the risks and benefits of limiting their health information<br>
    flow, there are limitations as to how much we can identify what will be the high value<br>
    information, result, channel or knowledge neurone within the caregiver’s therapeutic<br>
    knowledge alliance that may facilitate the patient’s healthcare at a future stage. Rather<br>
    than denying or trying to close down the therapeutic knowledge alliance, we should<br>
    increasingly recognise the centrality of patients and their supports within it, in terms of<br>
    building trust and recognising and managing the complexity and ambiguity of their<br>
    healthcare.</p>
